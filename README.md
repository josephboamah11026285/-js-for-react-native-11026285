### Project Overview

This project contains three main tasks designed to manipulate arrays and strings in JavaScript. Below is a brief explanation of each task.

### Task 1: `processArray`

**Functionality**:
- Takes an array of numbers as an argument.
- Returns a new array where:
  - Each even number is squared.
  - Each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: `formatArrayStrings`

**Functionality**:
- Takes two arrays as arguments:
  - An array of strings.
  - An array of numbers processed by `processArray`.
- Modifies each string based on its corresponding number:
  - Capitalizes the entire string if the number is even.
  - Converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: `createUserProfiles`

**Functionality**:
- Takes two arrays as arguments:
  - An array of original names.
  - An array of modified names (from Task 2).
- Returns an array of objects, each containing:
  - `originalName`: The original name from the first array.
  - `modifiedName`: The corresponding modified name from the second array.
  - `id`: An auto-incremented ID starting from 1.
